# Data Science Projects

### Data Science Projects that I have been working on.  

Artistic Style App: Deep Learning project. Using neural networks to train a filter on an image. Then apply that filter to another image.  
  
Loan App: Created an app that could predict whether or not a person would be accepted for a loan. Uses flask app, D3.js visuals, and Lending Club Loan Data.  
   
Movie Predictions: Data Munging project. Used Beautiful Soup to scrape data on Movies. Used that data to predict how long movies would remain in theaters.  

Magic the Gathering Thesaurus: NLP project on Magic the Gathering: Trading Card Game. Used KNN to identify the closest 10 cards to a given card. Used flask app, D3.js visualization, and Kaggle data. Future: Use recurrent neural networks to generate brand new cards.  
  
NBA Sociology Paper:  Wrote a research paper in NYU for an Indepent Study. Was reseearching the question, "Do sociological factors impact an NBA team's performance?"
